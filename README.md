# WonderQuest

Wonder Quest is a RPG where tailored procedurally generated system interact with eachother to multiply the adventures avaliable, while letting you choose how to interact with the world to accept or choose your goals, deepen your comitment or abandon them all thoghether, facing consequences for both choices.

## Dream statement

I want a world completly new and unexplored, where I can create a simple character and interact with the world, find quests, monsters, people, create conections, fight, and discover new things every time i set myself to do it or just hang around the city and make it better, change it, so my actions are always meagningful.

## Ideas and Considerations

- I want to be guilt free fighting mosnters, so 'killing' has a diagetic respawing mechanic
- - That means somethimes you 'kill' the same monster over and over, it may remember it
- - I want the hability to be cruel to exist, so it may have a way to trully kill something
- - Necromancy would be kinda weird but there would be an extra step to keep the body from turn into dust first I imagine
- - Killing may erase some memories or behaviours from the dead being, its despleasing at very least, you lose XP
- I want all characters to have behaviours matched with discreete signifiers, so an guy can be an _herbalist_ and _cranky_ and both can affect its dialog, or future quests may arise once they match with one or both of signifiers.
- Discovery is creation, and by that I mean, everywhere is somewhat undiscovered and full of potential, and so, if you go to a florest and explore enough you may find a berry, and then you know it will always have it around.
- - Sometimes quests spawn and force the behaviour into zones.
- - Sometimes you will be able to 'remember' something from the past, to allow characters to develop not only foward but build a background.
- - Once you put name into faces, you can find them again. Same for some monsters.
- World moves, sometimes a pack of wolfs can become stronger, sometimes you hurt them enough so they move away or just become fearful.
- Agents where npcs, instead of delivering quests passively are doing actvities.
- - Mainly thinking on bad guys that have their own agenda
- - a merchant travler could be it
- - a crafter may work like that for specfic, more meagninful equipment
- add a gauntlet as mouse icon
- gauges take attributes as information for its constitution
- make the player a little square
- make the player a Party not a Player
- add on the introduction that explains you are a force not the being
- Monsters
- - Wolves, Caterpie but Big!, Goblin, Centauro, Shark, Mermaids, Big Lizards, Bandits, Dragons, Wyvens, Slime, Bear, Cotton bunny but its like a plant? (fluffball)
- Multiplayer element!!
- - You get to a panteic statue and send a gift
- - "I here sacrifice a (gift) of (love)"
- - "I (preay) for a (gift) of (love)"
- Alchemia/cooking (itens with certain properties may replace others of same, its better to know the recipes but its possible to experiment. its a good idea to not punish experiments with less specific 'fail-state' potions/plates )
- cooking has taste descriptos in igridient that may change the final plate
- most interactions the sims like (glance over specifics, descrie hows abouts)
- its secondary quest skrim
